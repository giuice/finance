# Task Log: Critical Database Issues

## GOAL
Identify and fix two critical database issues:
1. Category duplication issue - categories are duplicating (two of each with same name) even after database reset
2. Catastrophic database performance degradation - pages that loaded instantly now take up to 10 minutes to load with minimal data

## INVESTIGATION PLAN
1. **Category Duplication**:
   - Examine database initialization code
   - Review category creation and storage logic
   - Check if there are multiple initialization points causing duplicates
   - Implement unique constraints or check for existing categories before creating new ones

2. **Performance Issue**:
   - Profile database operations to identify bottlenecks
   - Check for unnecessary or inefficient queries
   - Review React Query configuration for potential issues
   - Examine caching strategies and data fetching patterns
   - Check for unnecessary re-renders causing repeated database access
