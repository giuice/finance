# Database Performance and Duplication Fix Plan

## Issue Analysis

### Category Duplication Issue
The application is experiencing a critical bug where categories are duplicating (two of each category with same name), even after database reset. This suggests:

1. Possible issues with the database initialization logic
2. Lack of proper unique constraints or checks before category creation
3. Multiple execution paths that create default categories
4. Potential race conditions during initialization

### Database Performance Degradation
Database access has slowed dramatically - pages that previously loaded instantly now take up to 10 minutes to load with minimal data. Potential causes:

1. Inefficient query patterns or excessive database operations
2. React Query configuration issues (invalidation, refetching)
3. Memory leaks or excessive re-renders causing repeated database access
4. Unnecessary joins or complex queries
5. Missing indexes or other database optimization issues

## Action Plan

### 1. Immediate Investigation (Day 1)
- Examine database schema and initialization code
- Profile database operations to identify bottlenecks
- Review React Query usage across components
- Investigate component rendering patterns for inefficiencies

### 2. Category Duplication Fix (Day 1-2)
- Implement proper unique constraint for category names
- Add validation to prevent duplicate categories
- Fix initialization logic to check for existing categories
- Create cleanup utility to remove duplicates

### 3. Performance Optimization (Day 2-3)
- Refactor inefficient database queries
- Optimize React Query configuration
- Implement better caching strategies
- Reduce unnecessary re-renders
- Add appropriate indexes if needed

### 4. Testing (Day 3)
- Test fixes in various scenarios
- Verify performance improvements
- Ensure no regressions in functionality

### 5. Documentation (Day 3)
- Document changes made
- Update architecture documentation if needed
- Create guidelines for future database operations

## Success Criteria
1. No duplicate categories appear in the system
2. Database operations return to previous performance levels (near-instant)
3. All existing functionality works correctly
4. System remains stable under various user actions
